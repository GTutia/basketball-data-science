Hi! In this repository, you can find a few experiments on basketball data analysis

All the data here was obtained through [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) and [Sports Reference](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/)

The main files are the [Player evolution prediction v2](https://github.com/GTutia/basketball-data-science/blob/main/Player%20evolution%20prediction%20v2.ipynb) and the [College evolution prediction](https://github.com/GTutia/basketball-data-science/blob/main/College%20evolution%20prediction.ipynb)

Hope you enjoy!
